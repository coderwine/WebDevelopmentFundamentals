        ! HTML mini-lesson * 1
        ? When we start a new file within VSCode, we are able to utilize a feature within it to generate a "boilerplate".  We start this by typing out: 
            - ! + tab
        ? Let's cover some general concepts of some of these boilerplate tags:
            - DOCTYPE html state the type of document we have created.  In this case, we are stating a simple HTML5 doctype.
            ? There are other types that we can select from but this will be the primary that we will dive into.   *added to resources.txt

        ? What does HTML stand for exactly?
            - Hypertext Markup Language
        
        ? We create a head tag to store our metadata within.  This could be what type of viewport we want to specify, links to fonts, stylesheets and our document title.

        * The UTF is primarily used to cover all the characters, punctuations, and symbols of the world.

        ? Our viewport notes what is the current size that our page is being displayed on.  In this case, we are determining the width to aim for the device itself and scale as needed.

        ? Within our head tag, we can insert our CSS right into our HTML doc like so:

     <style>
         body {
             background-color: green;
         }
     </style>

    <!-- 
        ? Although we are capable of doing this, it is best to have our stylesheet as a separate document that we link to.  This is so that we can potentially style multiple items at once if we so desire.  

        ?  Let's inject our style.css
     -->

    <!-- * CSS Link -->
    <link rel="stylesheet" href="./CSS/style.css" type="text/css">
    
    <!-- 
        ? After our CSS connection we tested, we can see that our styles tag above it is being overwritten.  Why is this?
        - Our file is being read from top to bottom.
        - Technically our background changed to green, but during the loading process, it also noted our stylesheet and rendered it red per the attribute.
        ? Try swapping these to see what happens.

        ? Our title tag displays within the tab of our document and let's give it a little more flavor with a icon.  
        * will need to provide an icon.  Here is a quick link: https://icons8.com/icons/set/javascript

        ? The body of our document is what our users will view.  Anything that we want to display will need to go inside of our body tags.

        ? We will be building a sort of Notes site that will allow us to practice layout, styling, and JavaScript.  What we will want is:
        Main Aspecty of our Site:
        - A Main Navbar
        - Sections for our Notes
        - A Sidebar for Subtopics
        - A Footer
        ? This will be a basic site but something that you can most certainly play with and make your own.  What we build together will be mostly suggestions regarding colors and whatnot.  As we build, I hope that you will become comfortable with altering aspects to help you try out new things, test concepts, or simply refer back to as a source for your notes.

While we build, we aim to make pathways universal so that debugging can be done easier.  We can eliminate certain problems simply because everything is where it is to be expected.  This is also a trait you would probably like to see when picking up a project from a previous developer and having certain standards, we can assure that our product is capable of having the most "uptime" as possible when problems to arrise.
