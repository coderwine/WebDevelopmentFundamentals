# Web Development Fundamentals - ewinebrenner
This layout is meant for Instructional Resources in building out the first 4 weeks (FT course).  The goal of this project will be to house the framework of how a student will work within the learning environment.

Resources that help structure these notes:
  - VS Code extension **Better Comments**
  - Basic comments in code indicate note structure for the students.
  - ! (red) file/folder structure & Topic Headline
  - ? (blue) instructor notes not intended for student notes but guideline for instructional goals.
  - * (light green) pivot points.  These may direct to another file within the instructional guideline or line within the same file.

  - TXT files are meant to house general plans for daily/weekly lesson plans.  These will also house resource links that may dive deeper into general concepts.

# Status:
  - Builds will be sectioned off to explain various topics.  The goal is to focus on folder structure so that it makes sense and helps students move into Blue (and onto Red).

# TODO:
