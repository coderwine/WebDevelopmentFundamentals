# Web Development Fundamentals - ewinebrenner
This layout is meant for Instructional Resources in building out the first 4 weeks (FT course).  The goal of this project will be to house the framework of how a student will work within the learning environment.

Resources that help structure these notes:
    - VS Code extension **Better Comments**
      - Basic comments in code indicate note structure for the students.
      - ! (red) file/folder structure & Topic Headline
      - ? (blue) instructor notes not intended for student notes but guideline for instructional goals.
      - * (light green) pivot points.  These may direct to another file within the instructional guideline or line within the same file.

    - TXT files are meant to house general plans for daily/weekly lesson plans.  These will also house resource links that may dive deeper into general concepts.

# Status:
Working on importing a new HTML into the index.html
    - Is this simplifying the fundamental concepts?
    - Perhaps building a main page that we all fill out together so that the students can see something work right on their browser?

# TODO:
Building out the main Navbar to house the various weeks of Gold badge. 
    - would like for each week to display a set of options within a Sidebar of the topics covered.
    - Need to set EFA fonts properly.
    - Build out WK 1 in total
