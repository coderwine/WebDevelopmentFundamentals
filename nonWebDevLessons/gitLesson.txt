        git status
            // views the status of current folder and what files have either be altered, haven't been included to current repo/no repo.

        git add .
            // adds the current folder 

        git commit -m "message"

        git remote add origin *paste repo here*
            // connets your repo to the current directory in your workstation. This should only be done during the first connection.
            
        git push origin main
            // pushes the files/folder we noted within our "add" to the currently linked repo.
